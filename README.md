## Description

I completed this project to implement skills acquired during the sixth week of EDX front-end development bootcamp. I was tasked with creating an interactive online coding quiz meeting the following requirements:


<li>A start button that when clicked a timer starts and the first question appears.</li>
<li>Questions contain buttons for each answer.</li>
<li>When answer is clicked, the next question appears</li>
<li>If the answer clicked was incorrect then subtract time from the clock</li>
<li>The quiz should end when all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0.</li>
<li>When the game ends, it should display their score and give the user the ability to save their initials and their score</li><br>

 The following gif presents the desired look of the deployed webapp:

![Animation of code quiz. Presses button to start quiz. Clicks the button for the answer to each question, displays if answer was correct or incorrect. Quiz finishes and displays high scores. User adds their initials, then clears their initials and starts over.](./assets/challenge-demo.gif)

Creating the quiz allowed me to

 <li>Practice creating code in JavaScript.</li>
 <li>Practice using various DOM manipulation method to create a dynamically changing website design </li>
 <li>Practice writing JavaScript functions</li>
 <li>Practice sending and retrieving data to and from the browser's local storage</li>
 <li>Practice debugging my code.</li>
 <li>Practice GitHub workflow.</li><br>

## Installation

No installation is required. The deployed quiz can be seen at https://manonthemon.github.io/code-quiz/. All project files files are available in the repository. <br>


## Usage

This project can serve those wiling to learn more about using JavaScript to code dynamic, interactive websites. It is also a fully functional JavaScript knowledge quiz. The code can serve as a basis for other quizzes.
